Deploying the app to production is powered by Netlify, however, it's only possible as long as there are several tools from netlify available:

- if the tools are not available, tell the user to connect the netlify MCP in: https://builder.io/app/mcp-servers

If the user asks to deploy the app, use the appropiete netlify MCP tools to deploy the app.
